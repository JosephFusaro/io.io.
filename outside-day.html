    <h1>outside. day.</h1>

    <p>thank you for participating in this with me<br><br>
      there are so many things to do outside during the day.<br><br>
      are you traveling? farming? walking over alternating grass and concrete? its so big outside.<br><br>
      please enjoy this strange music while you do something or nothing.
