    <h1>outside. night.</h1>

    <p>thank you for participating in this with me.<br><br>
      outside at night - probably the most interesting. expansive darkness - sometimes cut through with natural or manmade light. <br><br>
      the potential for spookiness is here, surely, but not required. <br><br>
      please enjoy this strange music while you do something or nothing.<br><br>
