I used the stems app to separate out individual musical elements of songs I picked out from my digital music collection. the app will separate out bass, drums, acapella, piano, and another track labeled “other” — theoretically, these instrumental parts should sound isolated – but this is very difficult to achieve.
I’ve heard other apps do it better – but I really like the weird messed up results that came while doing this. Everything sounded… under-water-ish?
<br><br> I then used Reason Studios to play with looping those elements, adjusting them even more, slowing them down and speeding them up, adding additional sounds, I created approx. 50 different instrumental pieces.
Next, I used Logic Pro X to arrange and blend together 80 minutes of random soundscapes ranging from indoor spaces to outdoor spaces.
<br><br> I then sorted through all my instrumentals created in Reason Studios and started blending them together underneath the soundscapes.
<br><br>Eventually breaking them down into 4 individual 20 minute pieces of music &  soundscape representing indoors during the day, outdoors during the day, indoors during the night and finally outdoors during the night.
During the time I spent making the music, I taught myself some very basic HTML and CSS programing so I could create a very basic website to stream the music from and a portal, so people could purchase/download it.
this was fun. hope you like it.<br><br>
